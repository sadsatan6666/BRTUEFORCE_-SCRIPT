# BRTUEFORCE_-SCRIPT
This is an bruteforce script for filling up forms, first i analyzed the requests and response of browser and server, then i got to know that server uses JSON for data transmission, and then i used some tools like AI to make this script work (i know it varies upon targate you targeting , bettr to checl README for more info)
, (before you read further more pardon me for not using GPT for correcting grammer and documentation , my poor english at least undestandble , also sorry for spelling )
now get to the point 

this is an brute force script for filling up forms rapidly with speed (major factor of course depends on how powerfull and speedy the server response and server its' self is ), for me this particular site, major goals was to provide it an unique name and valid number (of course you can make fake numbers for it by python (heil python ...) , and i used GPT for making list of indian names ), before i made this script i have to analyse server response , browser request, and it realed alot info, browser sends JSON data , server accepts it 'that'is', and + and NOTE here

to let the server authenticate you , yuo just need an valid token ID which can be also faked (i mean you can use programming language libraries to make a fake token ), token is provided  within the browser request data .once your token is verified you can make many request as you can until your token gets expired or server bans you (if it have any machanics for banning aggressive IP client which sends more requests ), 


i know i am real shit at english , bye for now :)
